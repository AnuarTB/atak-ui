## Experience
We are redesigning the process of keeping track of the information about choreography creation.

### Target Users
Choreographers who want to create choreography. They are usually experienced dancers.

### Elephant

#### Description of the user

The user is the student of KAIST, who joined the university in the year 2014 and started his dancing career at that time. He went from the very beginner to amateur, to professional. He was the team leader of locking genre at Real Lunatic student club, but now he went up to become the head of the regular training (정기연습) for all Real Lunatic freshmen (As of Spring 2019).
For this time, he has experience of creating 10 choreographies for 10 performances, where each performance included 2-3 songs (sub-performances). So 10x(2-3) = 20-30 choreographies prepared in total. I would say this is an extreme user in terms of a large number of choreographies done with various levels of difficulty and for various groups of people.
 
_An excerpts and main points/insights from the Contextual Inquiry with the user:_
  
#### General
 - 2 separate devices were used:
 - A laptop was used for choosing, sorting out and listening to music.
 - iPad (+iPencil) was used for taking the notes about the choreography down.
 The user came with 20% movements already prepared, then added a song, then adds the rest of the movements.
 
#### Music choice
 - Having the music sorted out by bitrate (bpm) was very important for the user.
The process of choosing the music is not secondary but rather is very important. So we probably have to make the separate screen in the app for that.
 
#### Choreo creation
- He imagined the general pictures of how the group of people will move and “interact” at the beginning. Also thinking about feeling and motive of the music (powerful, funky, slow). Only after that, he started adding specific moves.
Contrary to the expectation (even though we must not have any expectations), there was no need for having the audio-track-line synced with the recorded movements. The only thing the user needed is having the music denoted by [bars/beats](#bar), as in Figure 1.

- During the drawing, the user denoted some checkpoints of the song by adding some specific words of the song. The word “yeah” was written down, when the singer says “yeah”.

- Music was re-listened many times (going 5-10 seconds back). So we have to add some easy navigation when listening to music again and again.

- He makes the notes of how people are staying along the lines of his dance moves, just with A DIFFERENT COLOR (denoted with red on Figure 1).

- He writes the name of the move below every bar/beat notation. However, there is a need for customization of each move.
For example, when he writes “Lock”, he needs to specify whether it is “left lock”, “right lock”, “lock with 1 hand/2 hand”. The user wants to customize it by being able to add comments or just photos (not videos).
Being able to copy or denote repetitions of the movements (or group of movements – aggregation) is important as well. The user just used some notations for that such as double lines, or writing “x2”.

### Giraffe

#### Description of the user

The interviewee has 9 years of experience in dancing, but only around 3 years in creating choreographies. In these 3 years, she created around 10 choreographies. She does European and Latino-American ballroom dancing.
 
_An excerpts and main points/insights from the Contextual Inquiry with the user:_

#### Choreo creation

- She has a set of moves that she uses in every dance. She memorized all these moves when she was taking ballroom dancing classes.

- Even though there is a limited set of moves what differs each time in each dance is the transitions between the moves and also the order of moves.
 
- For transitions, she watches youtube videos of ballroom dances to see how dancers there combine different moves.

- In ballroom dances, most moves require a lot of space and dancer moves around the scene. When she makes a move that leads her to the edge of the scene, she needs to add a move that will return her to the center of the scene.
 
- When ordering the moves and connecting them, she needs to balance the moves that require relocation on the scene and the ones that are performed on one spot so that she does not stay on one spot too much or she does not move too much across the scene.

- Selection of music depends on the type of dance (i.e. whether it is energetic or slow) and also on the outfit. She usually performs several dances at one concert and she cannot change her cloth between dances and therefore she needs to choose music that matches her outfit. (Example: if the outfit is for tango, then she needs to choose an energetic song).

- For choosing music, she needs to listen to a lot of songs. Each year new list of songs for ballroom dances are posted on the internet and she needs to listen to all of them to find an appropriate song for her dance. Even after choosing the song, she needs to edit the song so that it matches the moves in the dance perfectly. (For example, glue two verses together and remove the chorus and so on)

- Making one dance for the concert takes a lot of time. Just choosing music takes a considerable amount of time. Also, coming up with the transitions between moves takes a lot of time. However, making a dance for training takes much less time, because she usually uses default moves, transitions and music with a little bit of alteration for training.

- She usually dances with a partner. Therefore, they create a dance together. They both prepare a list of moves they want in a dance and then they narrow that list to only common elements of their lists.

- When she finds interesting transitions for moves on youtube, she shows them to her partner by scrolling several times over the part where the transition takes place.

- To prepare one dance, she and her partner have to meet a lot of times to come up with a finished choreography.

### Tiger

#### Description of the user

Tiger is a sophomore undergrad at KAIST who currently teaches regular ballroom dance classes. His experience in dancing 4 years of amateur dancing, 5 years of professional ballroom dancing (B class). As for his experience of choreography, he has started to compose dances 3.5 years ago and started teaching dances 1.5 years ago. 

_An excerpts and main points/insights from the Contextual Inquiry with the user:_

#### Choreo creation

- Although it is not important, Tiger watches other dance performances in the search of the inspiration for his new dance. 

- Dances can be categorized by their mood, genre, pace and so on. So user usually chooses some category of dance, that he wants to perform, but sometimes the idea is borrowed from different types of dances. 

- Tiger starts the process of making choreographies by searching the playlist for the interesting music.

  - For this dance, he wants the music to be dynamic. The mood of the song is important for the dance.  

- After, finding a suitable song, Tiger starts to count the beats of the song and is looking for the accent(volume) changes in the song. It is needed to create transitions from one dance move (mood) to another. 

- During this process, he extracts the ideas for the dance moves from the song. However, the opposite is also true, the music choice can be influenced by the dance moves, the performer wants to do.

- The next stage is more focused not on the number of beats, but their role. Tiger, at this stage, listens to the song again, to memorize the time marks for the strong beats, weak beats, and some interesting beat subdivisions. 

- Now comes the longest stage of this creative process. Tiger counts the beats by himself, and make some draft moves in front of the mirror. In some cases, he can discuss which dance moves can be carried out with his partner(s). 
Remark: At this stage, he prefers to have the music in the background, to have a sense of music. 

- After, composing the sequence of the dance moves, Tiger turns on the music and starts to rehearse the dance, with the partner(s). According to the user, the proper technique is not that important as the right timing of the dance moves.

- After achieving some mastery, Tiger I starts to record a video of himself, with music. This will, in turn, helps him to recognize the errors and correct them. The errors are usually related to the timing and position. 


### Rabbit 

#### Description of the user

The Rabbit is a freshman student at KAIST, she likes dancing in her free time. She is also a Real Lunatic Club member. As for now, she has little experience at choreography(1 dance performance). She is an extreme user.

_An excerpts and main points/insights from the Contextual Inquiry with the user:_

#### Choreo creation

- Music was chosen by popularity and energetic temp

- As the user is inexperienced, someone’s choreography was chosen as a base for the creation of dance.

- The song was divided into main parts. 

- She played the song for 20 times until she got perfection. 

- It was hard for her to remember all the movements at once and keep it all just in her head since she didn’t use any notes for keeping track of movements

## Needs
---
1. Choose the right song by some criteria such as pace, mood, and genre. 

2. Find inspiration in the videos of other performances, usually sorted out by one style.

3. Customize the recording of each move by adding comments, pictures, videos. 

4. Divide song into bars, to conveniently navigate in the song, clearly see the beats (strong beats, weak beats), and denote  the move performed in each part.

5. Subdivide the song into several main parts.

6. Film a video with synchronized audio, i.e when the user starts recording, the app needs to simultaneously play the music. 

7. Pause a recording and leave a comment by either drawing or texting. The user wants to, correct the mistake, by labeling it in the video, by some time mark. 

8. Loop the track for several purposes. Firstly, in order to learn the movement, it is convenient to repeat a certain video segment. Secondly, to analyze the dance movements and correct the mistakes. 

9. Duplicate the moves (or a set of moves), so that user can efficiently edit the dance sequence. 

10. Compare two videos, with a synchronized audio track.


## Insights
---

1. The pace of the song (bpm, the subdivision into bars) is important for the dancers.

2. Consideration of the role of beats(strong, weak) and mood transitions in the song, will determine the structure of dance. 

3. For every dance style, there is some limited set of basic moves. However, there are multiple ways to customize them. So noting down the details of each move is important.

4. Rehearsing the dance is a repetitive action, so looping the track is quite a common routine. 

5. Dancers refer to other choreos while making their own one. 

6. The visual record of the dance is important as a tool for spotting mistakes and important details.

7. Some users prefer to take down notes of choreo, while others do not write down anything.

8. Usually when the dance performance consist of several songs, it is a good rule of thumb for them to have almost the same bpm. 

9. The repetitions of some movements (or groups of movements) happen in almost every dance.

10. All choreographers use different ways to keep track of the choreo movements and flow: some take down the detailed notes, while others might just keep most of the choreo in their head.

11. Video processing, such as recording video synced with the audio or making some drawings on the video, is an important visual help for the choreographers. 

## Appendix

 - <a id="bar">**Bar**</a> (or measure) is a segment of time corresponding to a specific number of beats in which each beat is represented by a particular note value and the boundaries of the bar are indicated by **vertical** bar lines. Dividing music into bars provides regular reference points to pinpoint locations within a musical composition. It also makes written music easier to follow, since each bar of staff symbols can be read and played as a batch.

  - In music and music theory, the **beat** is the basic unit of time, the pulse (regularly repeating event), of the mensural level (or beat level).

  - **Bitrate** refers to the number of bits or the amount of data that are processed over a certain amount of time. In audio, this usually means **kilobits per second** or, shortly, **kbps**.

 - **Choreography** is the art or practice of **designing sequences of movements** of physical bodies (or their depictions) in which motion, form, or both are specified. Choreography may also refer to the design itself.

  - In the performing arts, a **performance** generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more works of art to an audience.
