## Participants

- We chose three participants as similar to the **persona** as possible. 
- They are all choreographers at Real Lunatic Dance Crew, we recruited them just by invitation.

1. P1.
**Nationality**: South Korea
**Age**: 21
**Membership**: Real Lunatic Street Dance Crew
**Experience**: 3 years in dancing, 10 choreos prepared
**Style**: popping, locking

1. P2.
**Nationality**: South Korea
**Age**: 24
**Membership**: Real Lunatic Street Dance Crew
**Experience**: 5 years in dancing, 20 choreos prepared
**Style**: locking, hip-hop

1. P3.
**Nationality**: South Korea
**Age**: 20
**Membership**: Real Lunatic Street Dance Crew
**Experience**: 2 years in dancing, 6 choreos prepared
**Style**: house, locking

## Briefing

"Dear User,

Thank you for taking time to participate in our prototype testing. We will ask you to do 3 tasks on the paper prototype of our project.

With our project, we are trying to redesign the process of keeping track of the information about choreography creation. By using our app, you can choose a song and edit it to come up with a perfect song for your dance. For that song, which will be divided into small parts (bars), you can add comments, photos, videos and simple sketches under each part of the song."

## Tasks

1. Add a photo to the track timeline.
- Why it is essential task: the photo is one of the key ways to capture the dance move, where the **exact** positions of hands, legs, and body during dance can be seen.
- Why it is distinct task: it includes pressing the "+ Add Note" button, choosing "Photo", then **capturing yourself** or **choosing picture from gallery**, and adding it to the timeline.


2. Draw a sketch and add it to the track timeline.
- Why it is essential task: sketches can be done during moments when you can't take a picture (e.g. when you are inspired to think about choreo sitting at cafe (as said in the Contextual Inquiry);  sketch can help the user to depict the relative position of choreographers during the dance.
- Why it is distinct task: it includes directly accessing the sketch editor, **drawing the sketch**, and adding it to the track timeline.


3. Make some part of the song play on repeat.
- Why it is essential task: it is frequently needed for the dancers to focus on specific part of the dance during rehearsal.
- Why it is distinct task: it involves mostly working with the track timeline and audio rather than customizing the moves by adding media or comments.

## Observations

### Theme 1: Learnibility

**Task 1**


- Users didn't know that if you press on the added photo/comment/sketch/video on the timeline (in different sections of song), it will be opened in the full-screen mode. (P2, Medium)

    **How we plan to improve it**: 

    - We can scale the track timeline (user can increase or decrease the size of each bar), so that user can either see the added pictures/comments/sketches more clearly, or scale them down if needed.
    - We can show that photo/comments/sketches can be pressed to make them full screen in the tutorial

**Task 3**

- After users chose region of the song for looping they didn't know they needed to press the play button. (P1, Medium)
-  It is not intuitive that user can change the pace (BPM) of the song (i.e no button or highlight that would make it clear). (P2, Medium)

    **How we plan to improve it**: 
    - We believe that after we implement the prototype that really supports the song playing, it will become obvious that you need to press play button after choosing loop region since otherwise there won't be anything playing unless the button is pressed. Also speed changing button can be easily distinguished in the computer prototype.

**General**
- Add some help button would be helpful to learn the UI. (P1, P3, Low)

    **How we plan to improve it**:
    -  Another alternative is to add "?" button, which displays the functionality of each button.

### Theme 2: Affordance

**Task 1**
- Participants suggested to change the "+ Add Note" button (not clear that photo or sketch is added by pressing that button). Also, they said that "Note" word is ambiguous. (P1, P2, P3, High)

- Users confused the general menu button with the "+ Add Note" button. (P1, P3, Medium)



    **How we plan to improve it**:
    - Change the wording from "+ Add Note" to "+ Add" or just big highlighted "+" sign.



**Task 2**

- Participants struggled to accomplish first task, but after the first task, it was easy to use our prototype. (P1, P2, Medium)

    **How we plan to improve it**: 
    - Since it became quite intuitive to participants how to work after they got hand of it, it would be useful to add short tutorial during the first trial.

**General**

- Save button is not clear (drawing of the button is not really good). (P3, Low)

### Theme 3: Usability

**Task 1**

- User wants to add photos, sketches for each bar separately (i.e. to have "add" button for each bar rather than one universal "add" button) (P3, Medium). 

    **How we plan to improve it**
    - By P3's suggestion, add the "+" button to each bar, since "the whole interaction is happening at the bars" as expressed by P3.

**Task 2**

- Drawing sketch might be improven by adding more tools such as "add figure(circle, square)". (P1, Low)


**General**

- There is no undo button. (P1, High)

    **How we plan to improve it**

    - We are planning to add undo button to the main page, so after user press undo his latest update will be deleted. 





## Individual Reflections

Each member of the team played the same role consistently for all the participants.

### Temirlan Myrzakhmetov - Facilitator

As a facilitator, it was very tempting to guide the users at moments when they were confused about our interface and give them detailed guidance. The reason is that when the users are confused abous some buttons, they try to refer to me for detailed explanation instead of learning by doing. Apparently, my duty was only to provide general task guidance, while leaving the whole interaction and trial-and-error process to users.
It was also tempting to just talk to users about our project, but instead I had to show them the briefing and the task cards first, to ensure the consistency among the users.

### Anuar Talipov - Human Computer

As a computer I have witnessed the users, when they were learning the interface and I have observed some patterns. Our app had some common player controls (like play and pause), and some interface controls that were related to music (bpm, bars, looping). What was interesting is that users more frequently interacted with the parts of the interface that they were already familiar with (e.g. "Play" button). However, sometimes users wanted to try non-existent features, like calling context menu for some non active elements. Vice versa, is also true, active elements due to low fidelity of feel, were not perceived by users as clickable or draggable. In conclusion, I think we might need either to highlight active elements or make some tutorial to explain users what is allowed and what is not. 

### Alim Amanzholov - Observer

I played the role of observer in all the sessions in the paper prototype testing. Sometimes when our computer or facilitator made mistakes I wanted to correct them, but I had to back off since I am not supposed to talk and interfere with the process of testing. It required some effort to not interfere with the process. It was not difficult to spot some unusual behavior of the user and therefore coming up with the observations about our prototype. It was frustrating at times to see that our prototype is not intuitive in some parts, especially the adding photo part.

### Kunduz Baryktabasova - Observer
As an observer in the paper prototype testing in all 3 sessions, it was very important to take precise notes for P1 (first participant).  Other participants had mostly the same struggles, so I just added P1, P2, or both to each observation. During observation I realized some bad sides of our prototyping and I already had an idea how can we modify our prototyping so it will be more intuitive for users. By doing observation I understand users behavior, how they tend to think which is usually not same as I do. It was also difficult to keep my mouth shut, since I wanted to correct facilitator and human computer. 

## Studio Reflection

- More distinct tasks (first and second tasks are similar). 

    **Addressing:** In the task part, after each task, we explained which reasoning we used for choosing *essential* and *distinct* tasks.
Particularly, the reason why first and second tasks are distinct, is because for the sketch, using the editor and drawing the sketch is different set of actions, especially for choreography creation.

---

- It was suggested to add the following task:
  "Add another task about selecting or editing music tracks".

    **Addressing:** We are working on that feature, but didn't add it for this time, since we chose other tasks.

---

- Explaining the meaning of the [bar](#bar) (1:1, 2:1) in the prototype; 
- Explaining "locking, hip-hop" kind of words.

    **Addressing:** Our test users didn't have problems understanding what the bars and notations (x: y) meant, since they are experienced dancers.
    We also added the appendix for those who need to understand what this means. 
    Additionally, we explained all of this to the studio members during Q&A.
    
--- 
- It was suggested to group observations by themes and subdivide each by tasks.

    **Addressing:** We modifed our groupping as suggested. 
---

- It was suggested to us that we chose more diverse target users. Particularly, "invite dancers from 'Illusion' crew, not just 'Real Lunatic'".

    **Addressing:** We contend that our target users are already quite diverse within the "persona" that we focused on. They are all different-aged, have high (as a persona) but still varying choreo experience, and all practice different dance styles. 
    We do not think that inviting the students from "Illusion" club will make things better. Rather, we made focus on choosing dancers from different dance styles.
    If we make it more diverse, e.g. invite people with no experience in dancing, then it won't be suitable to our target users (or "persona").
    
## Appendix

 ### Meaning of (1:1, 2:1, etc) notation in paper prototype UI.
 
 - The notation (x: y) denotes (the bar number: the beat number). For example, (3:4) means 3rd bar, 4th beat of the song.
 
 ### Glossary

 - <a id="bar">**Bar**</a> (or measure) is a segment of time corresponding to a specific number of beats in which each beat is represented by a particular note value and the boundaries of the bar are indicated by **vertical** bar lines. Dividing music into bars provides regular reference points to pinpoint locations within a musical composition. It also makes written music easier to follow, since each bar of staff symbols can be read and played as a batch.

  - In music and music theory, the **beat** is the basic unit of time, the pulse (regularly repeating event), of the mensural level (or beat level).

  - <a id="bpm">**Bitrate**</a> refers to the number of bits or the amount of data that are processed over a certain amount of time. In audio, this usually means **kilobits per second** or, shortly, **kbps**.

 - <a id="choreo">**Choreography**</a> is the art or practice of **designing sequences of movements** of physical bodies (or their depictions) in which motion, form, or both are specified. Choreography may also refer to the design itself.

  - In the performing arts, a **performance** generally comprises an event in which a performer or group of performers present one or more works of art to an audience. 

 - **Locking, hip-hop, house, etc** are just the dance styles.
