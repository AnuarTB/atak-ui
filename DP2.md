## POV

 - **We met** a professional street dancer with vast choreo experience.

 - **We were amazed to realize** that he chooses a song for performance by pace and records the movements by writing down some generalizing names while later attempting to customize them.

 - **It’d be game-changing to** sort the music by bpm and allow user to customize each part of the song by adding comments, photos and videos.
